# Welcome to STTK 

STTK - short for Systematic Trading Toolkit - is a suite of open source modules, datasets and tutorials designed to support the full lifecycle of systematic trading efforts: from idea generation, realistic event-driven backtesting and robustness-focused optimisation, through the definition of a portfolio integration pipeline for the selected strategies, to their monitored live execution and eventual discontinuation.
